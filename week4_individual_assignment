I participated in the Day 2 Workshop Introduction to QGIS. I found the workshop to be very informative in understanding the levels of buffers that can be 
created to analyze specific regions and variables. In this workshop, we had a practice scenario of mapping housing that was within 20 minutes of UCLA, rented 
for less than $1300, and had two grocery stores within walking distance. It was insightful to learn the basics of uploading data and compiling them into QGIS 
to create layered projections of different datasets. I was particularly impressed by how fast we were able to compile the data and even create buffer points of 
the grocery stores in the area. This will be particularly useful in our research as we hope to be able to compile the locations of business closures and plot 
where landlords in South LA (particularly the top 6) own property. We are also looking at eviction rates for the three areas in South LA and I can imagine 
that using QGIS will help us to visualize the Laser Zone in South LA along with buffer points of business closures, new developments, and properties owned by
the top 6 landlords. I would like to learn how to access QGIS through UCLAâ€™s VPN as my computer was slow to keep up with the workshop.
